# **Edmund O Callaghan | Interactive Front-End Development Toolkit Project**

This is my toolkit web app that serves to help the everday user. 
It has a fully functioning Irish income tax calculator that calculates how much tax you've been charged or will be charged, it calculates your net pay for the year or what could be your net pay for the year. It also give you a breakdown on what your annual net income is per week. 

The toolkit also has a fuel consumption to distance calculator or most commonly refered to as a miles per gallon calculator. With this calculator you can input your miles or kilometers traveled, how much fuel you used and you can convert your mpg to the UK rate at 4.25 liters per gallon or the US rate at 3.75 liters per gallon.

The web app also contains forms of contacting me in my footer, via email, github and linkedin, and via the dropdown navbar modal conact me section.

## User Experience

### User stories
As an end-user I want to access the tools on this web app with ease, I want quick calculations and simple data that doesn't over complicate the situation, as in what was the tax you paid for the year, and what was the mpg I achieved.

Any employers who visit my site will wannt to see my level of design and consistancy, along with the ability to write functioning code for interactivity and calculations and passing values from one method to another.

Any recruiters who visit my web app will want to see if my projects meet the requirments of any position they are recruiting for.

### Strategy
In this project my main goal was to create a consistancy in design flow, and colour schemes. The web app is designed mobile first, in regards to content layout and css media queries, as most users use a mobile phone these days, but the site does respond nicely to desktop and laptop screens.

The main goal in this project was the applications themselves and they're to showcase my skills with javascript, jquery, css, bootstrap, and html.

### Scope
The scope of the project was to provide an application that the end-user could use in there day to day use and would respond primarily on a mobile device, and showcase my javascript and jquery skills to date.

### Structure
The key aspects of the nvabar was to have the ability to dropdown the navbar and create an positive emotional response to the user, and give them links to my linkedin and github. It also allows them to fill out a contact me form and using Emailjs to send it to my email address. 

Also in the footer there is the same links, bar the conact me button, but this is replaced with an email icon which open up microsofts email application on your device or gmail on your mobile device. This give the end-user two options as to contacting me by, along with linkedin and github.

### Surface

#### Red shades: 
rgb(102, 10, 10);
rgba(138, 58, 58);
rgb(199, 60, 60);
rgb(196, 23, 23);

#### Cream/White shades: 
rgb(199, 235, 224);
rgb(255, 245, 245);
rgb(255, 255, 255);

#### Grey scaled shades are also included within the application.

The colour scheme I was going for is this web application was to match up with a impactful contrast, yet pleasing to the eye, and above all evoking a positive response from the end-user.   

## Features


 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

Note: on edge browser getting footer links blue, as oppsed to red, and contact me is black as opposed to red, two warning on console, I have checked both, one is regarding a closing div tag that is unexpected, but I double checked it and it is meant to be there, the other one is regarding the closing body tag, which is fine, I double checked that also. no errors like this show up on chrome or firefox.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
